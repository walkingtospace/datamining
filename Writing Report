Abstract

1. Introduction
  talk about yelp elite. why are we doing this? 
      secret. elusive yelp elite club
      Yelp Elites -> 
      "Authenticity, Contribution, and Connection"
      
      people apply for elite without knowing exact criteria. (only vague outlines)
      yelp doesn't want people to know. we are going to study correlations and find the hidden criteria.
      
4. Other literature / previous work
  no explicit on this particular task
  this dataset is from Yelp Challenge.
  what other similar datasets have been studied in the past and how? (finding java experts among java forums)
  finding experts among social graph (in academia) e.g. (TF) (graph)
  TFIDF in text mining
      
2. Exploratory Analysis
     dataset is from Yelp Challenge. 
    
    structure of the data. review, users, tips (checkin business not used)
    which cities dataset come 
    How many data points htis have (users, reviews)
    Some statistic stuff (studying the dataset) graphs
    
    
3.  Predictive Task

     What are we trying to predict? 
     Is this user an elite or not (given complete history in the dataset)?
     definition of elite = ever been an elite
     
     initial features -> using out intution
     Correlation analysis (table)
     
     
3-5. Our Model
   final model: 
    Why are we using this model?: This is classification task -> Logistic Regression / SVM / Naive Bayes / RF(?)
    TOo many features model really slow.
    perforamnce of the model. f1 score.
    TFIDF very slow -> 1000 terms (total number of terms a lot larger)
    
    unsuccesful attempts (if you use partition by year, than you would have to take outu a lot features due to no 
    time information in friendship date, fan date etc, compliment date etc, we lack timestamp on social data which we found 
    useful in our correltion analysis?)
    
    F1 score. strength/weakness - 
    
    compare corrleation analysis result what the model thinsks is important (lr.coeff_ or svm.coeff_, naive bayes_coef)
    we can talk about unexpected /expected
    more features: terms, word cloud, geo spatial
    
    does review quality matter more? or social feature matter more?

5.Conclusion
  In our study, a model of treu f1 score of 0.96 was developed through SVM. Most important features were ____. It seems that
  leveraging on ____ ____ will help users to become elite for the upcoming year.
  
  
  Discussion - if we had temporatl information on some features we could have made more intricate model
