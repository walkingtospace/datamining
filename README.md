Prediction for hidden factors of Yelp Elite election

Model: 

## Feautures:

## 1. Review's quality

-> the average length of reviews

-> the number of words in review

-> the number of vote

-> generality : how the review rating is far from the average rating?

-> text mining

## 2. General activity (quantified)

-> review_count

-> average_stars

-> votes

-> the number of friends

-> the number of compliments

-> the number of fans 

-> the number of tip likes

-> the average length of tips

-> the average number of words in tips

## 3. Social activity

-> the hub/authenticity weight by social graph analysis

-> The number of elite friends

## 4. Locality 

Assumption : If a user who wanna be a elite has short user distance from the local elites, he/she would have more chance to be elected. (people should get a good peer-review score from the local community to be a elite)

-> How many tips/reviews he has written about the local restaurant?

-> Similarity with the local elites 

-> How many friends are the local elites?
